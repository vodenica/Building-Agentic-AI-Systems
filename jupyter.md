#### How to Run a Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb`) on Your Local Machine

**Step 1: Install Jupyter Notebook**

If you havenâ€™t already, install Jupyter Notebook using pip:

```
pip install notebook
```

Or, if you use Anaconda, Jupyter is included by default.

---

**Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook**

Open your terminal (or command prompt), navigate to the folder containing your `.ipynb` file, and run:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This command will start a local server and open the Jupyter Notebook dashboard in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:8888`. From there, you can click on your `.ipynb` file to open and run it interactively .

---

**Step 3: Run All Cells in the Notebook**

Once your notebook is open in the browser:
- Use the menu: **Cell > Run All** to execute all cells.
- Or, run cells one by one using **Shift + Enter**.

---

**Alternative: Run Notebook from Terminal (Non-Interactive)**

If you want to execute the notebook straight from the terminal (without opening the browser), you can use:

```
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute your_notebook.ipynb
```

This will run all cells and save the output in a new notebook file .
