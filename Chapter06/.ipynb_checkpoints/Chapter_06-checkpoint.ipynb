    "The **CWD** model is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the development of multi-agent\n",
    "systems, emphasizing `collaboration`, `specialization`, and `effective distribution` of tasks and resource\n",
    "management. Just as human organizations benefit from clear role delegation and hierarchical structures,\n",
    "intelligent agents can achieve greater effectiveness through thoughtful division of labor. The **CWD** framework, as shown in Figure 6.1 below, draws inspiration from organizational psychology and management\n",
    "theory, adapting proven principles of human coordination to the field of intelligent agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "![The CWD model](figures/Figure_6.1–The_CWD_model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is particularly valuable as agent systems grow in complexity and need to handle increasingly intricate\n",
    "tasks that require multiple specialized capabilities working in concert. This model is particularly well-suited for environments where autonomous agents must collaborate to achieve complex objectives that may be beyond the capabilities of a single agent."

    "\n",
    "- **Workers**: Workers are specialized agents with diverse expertise who execute specific tasks assigned by delegators, leveraging their unique skills to enable efficient division of labor and optimize overall system performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Key principles of the CWD model\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CWD** model is founded on several key principles that guide its design and implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Separation of concerns**: The fundamental philosophy behind **CWD** is _**the clear separation of\n",
    "responsibilities**_ between **strategic planning** (_coordinator_), **resource management** (_delegator_),\n",
    "and **task execution** (_worker_). This separation allows each component to focus on its core\n",
    "competencies while maintaining system flexibility and scalability.\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "2) **Hierarchical organization**: The model implements a hierarchical structure that mirrors successful organizational patterns found in human institutions:\n",
    "    - **Top level**: Strategic oversight and planning.\n",
    "    - **Middle level**: Resource management and coordination.\n",
    "    - **Base level**: Specialized task execution.\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "3) **Information flow and feedback loops**: The **CWD** model emphasizes bidirectional\n",
    "communication flows:\n",
    "    - **Downward flow**: Task assignments, priorities, and constraints.\n",
    "    - **Upward flow**: Progress updates, results, and resource utilization.\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "4) **Adaptability and resilience**: The model is designed to be inherently adaptable through the following:\n",
    "   - **Dynamic resource allocation**: Agents continuously assess workload demands and redistribute computational or operational resources in real time to optimize efficiency and prevent bottlenecks.\n",
    "   - **Fault tolerance through redundancy**: The system employs multiple agents with overlapping capabilities, allowing seamless handoff and recovery in case of failures, and ensuring uninterrupted operations.\n",
    "   - **Load balancing across agents**: Tasks are intelligently distributed among agents based on their availability, expertise, and current workload, preventing performance degradation and improving responsiveness.\n",
    "   - **Runtime role reassignment**: Agents can adapt their roles based on evolving system needs, stepping into different responsibilities as required to maintain workflow continuity and operational effectiveness."

    "## The CWD model for the intelligent travel agent\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let’s discuss how the **CWD** model may be implemented for the intelligent travel agent system. The overall structure and flow may be as follows:\n",
    "- **Coordinator agent**: This agent will act as the travel planning coordinator. This agent will be responsible for the following:\n",
    "    - Managing the overall travel planning process based on a user request.\n",
    "    - Facilitating progress monitoring and effective collaboration among worker agents.\n",
    "    - Assigning tasks and coordinating the workflow based on the customer’s travel requirements.\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "- **Worker agents**: There can be a number of different agents, each specializing in its own domain and expertise within travel and hospitality management:\n",
    "    - **Flight booking worker**: Specialized in searching for and booking flight options based on travel dates, destinations, and preferences.\n",
    "    - **Hotel booking worker**: Focused on finding and reserving suitable accommodations based on location, amenities, and customer preferences.\n",
    "    - **Activity planning worker**: Responsible for researching and planning activities, tours, and experiences at the travel destination, tailored to the customer’s interests.\n",
    "    - **Transportation worker**: Specialized in arranging ground transportation, such as rental cars, airport transfers, or local transportation options.\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "- **Delegator agent**: This agent will act as the travel task delegator agent. This agent performs the following:\n",
    "    - Acts as an interface between the _**travel planning coordinator**_ and the _**specialized worker agents**_.\n",
    "    - Receives travel planning tasks from the coordinator.\n",
    "    - Assesses the capabilities and availability of worker agents.\n",
    "    - Assigns appropriate tasks to the suitable worker agents based on their expertise and workload.\n",
    "    - Coordinates and balances the workload among the worker agents.\n",

    "1. A user approaches the intelligent travel agent system with their travel requirements, such as destination, travel dates, budget, and preferences (for example, family-friendly, cultural experiences, and beach vacation).\n",
    "2. The travel planning coordinator analyzes the customer’s requirements and breaks down the overall travel planning task into subtasks. This is where the task decomposition happens, as we learned about in the previous chapter.\n",
    "3. The coordinator communicates these subtasks to the travel task delegator.\n",
    "4. The delegator assesses the available worker agents and assigns tasks accordingly.\n",
    "5. The worker agents collaborate and coordinate with each other as needed, sharing relevant information and ensuring a cohesive travel plan.\n",
    "6. The delegator monitors the progress of the tasks and ensures workload balance among the worker agents.\n",
    "7. Once all the tasks are completed, the worker agents submit their respective outputs (for example, flight bookings, hotel reservations, activity itineraries, and transportation arrangements) to the delegator.\n",
    "8. The delegator compiles and integrates the outputs from the worker agents into a comprehensive travel plan.\n",
    "9. The travel planning coordinator reviews the final travel plan, makes any necessary adjustments, and presents it to the customer for approval."

You may also notice that at certain points the delegator failed to invoke the tool. This happens in case the LLM was unable to capture the required variables for the tool, at which point the CrewAI framework will retry the call by re-crafting it's inputs until it gets a proper tool call (often with smaller or cheaper LLMs). This is unfortunately one of the drawbacks of generic implementations, however with more custom implementations with CrewAI, you can steer the model to generate appropriate tool calls everytime given all the information is present.<br/>\n",

    "Also note that the max_iter and max_retries_limit is set to 1 and 3 which means the agent will only be invoked once and will retry 3 times if there are errors. This means that the Agent may not come to a perfect answer with just 1 try, you may try to increast max_iter on the agents to experiment with the type of answers it produces.\n",
