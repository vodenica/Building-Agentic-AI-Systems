    "\n",
    "We will expand our previous example and introduce tool use. Note that the tools use static JSON data, however these tools can actually perform external actions such as API calls, database updates and so on. Let's first define all the tools we want the agent to use with CrewAI.\n",

    "**NOTE**: The tool functions accept parameters in our examples, however these parameters are not used inside of the tool functions. In a typical use-case, you will make use of these parameter values inside the function to execute some logic or code for e.g., run a search using an external travel search API and pass the parameters as filter conditions. This tool function code is for demonstration purposes to explain the concepts."

In such cases, you might want to provide a \"pick-up where you left off\" feature to your user. This can be implemented using a mechanism called \"Checkpointing\" with LangGraph using the `MemorySaver()` which introduces a level of data persistence of the entire state of the workflow. This can be a very powerful in various sitatuation such as pause-resume workflow, human intervention etc. Read more about checkpointing here - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/\n",
