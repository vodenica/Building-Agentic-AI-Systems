    "At its core, **tool** usage by an intelligent agent refers to the LLM agent’s capability of leveraging external\n",

    "processes. This concept extends beyond the traditional notion of an agent as a self-contained (isolated)\n",
    "entity, relying solely on its internal knowledge (training data) and algorithms. Instead, it acknowledges\n",
    "the potential for agents to transcend their intrinsic limitations by strategically harnessing the power\n",
    "of external tools and systems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, when you send a query (“What’s the weather?”) to an agent in isolation, the model is free\n",
    "to either respond with any made-up answer or it may respond that it doesn’t know how to find the\n",
    "weather. In this case, the agent will rely on the LLM’s training data, which will not have up-to-date\n",

    "Understanding how agents work with these tools involves the following several key considerations that\n",
    "affect their effectiveness and reliability. These aspects are crucial for developing robust agent systems\n",
    "that can handle complex real-world tasks while maintaining security, handling errors gracefully, and\n",
    "adapting to changing requirements:\n",
    "- **Tool composition and chaining**: Agents often need to combine multiple tools to accomplish\n",
    "complex tasks. Tool composition allows agents to create sophisticated workflows by chaining\n",
    "tools together. For example, a travel planning agent might first use an API to check flight\n",
    "availability, then a database tool to retrieve user preferences, and, finally, a utility function to\n",
    "calculate optimal itineraries. This chaining capability significantly extends what agents can\n",
    "accomplish beyond using tools in isolation.\n",
    "- **Tool selection and decision-making**: One of the most critical aspects of tool usage is the\n",
    "agent’s ability to select the appropriate tool for a given task. Agents must evaluate the context,\n",
    "understand the requirements, and choose the most suitable tool or combination of tools. This\n",
    "involves considering factors such as tool capabilities, reliability, performance, and cost. The\n",
    "agent must also handle cases where multiple tools could solve the same problem, selecting the\n",
    "most efficient option.\n",
    "- **Error handling and fallbacks**: When working with tools, agents must be prepared for potential\n",
    "failures and have strategies to handle them. This includes detecting failed API calls, managing\n",
    "database connection issues, or handling incorrect function outputs. Robust error handling\n",
    "often involves implementing fallback mechanisms, where agents can switch to alternative tools\n",
    "or approaches if the primary method fails.\n",
    "- **Tool state management**: Many tools maintain state or require specific initialization and\n",
    "cleanup procedures. Agents need to manage these tool states effectively, ensuring proper\n",
    "resource allocation and release. This includes managing database connections, maintaining\n",
    "API authentication tokens and handling session states for various services.\n",
    "- **Tool updates and versioning**: Tools evolve over time with new versions and capabilities. Agents\n",
    "need strategies to handle tool updates, version compatibility, and deprecated features. This\n",
    "might involve maintaining compatibility with multiple versions of a tool, gracefully handling\n",
    "deprecated features, and adapting to new tool interfaces.\n",
    "- **Tool security and access control**: Security considerations are crucial when agents interact\n",
    "with tools, especially those accessing sensitive data or critical systems. This includes managing\n",
    "authentication credentials, implementing proper authorization checks, and ensuring secure\n",
    "communication channels. Agents must also respect rate limits and usage quotas imposed by\n",
    "various tools."

    "`AutoGen` is an open-source framework developed by Microsoft that enables developers to build advanced applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) through the use of multiple AI agents. These agents can converse and collaborate with each other to solve complex tasks, making it easier to orchestrate, automate, and optimize workflows that involve LLMs. AutoGen is designed to maximize the performance of LLMs and overcome their limitations by allowing agents to take on specialized roles and work together seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: CrewAI\n",
    "\n",
    "We will expand our previous example and introduce tool use. Note that the tools use static **JSON** data; however, these tools can actually perform external actions such as API calls, database updates, and so on. Let's first define all the tools we want the agent to use with CrewAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The tool functions accept parameters in our examples; however, these parameters are not used inside the tool functions. In a typical use case, you will make use of these parameter values inside the function to execute some logic or code, e.g., run a search using an external travel search API and pass the parameters as filter conditions. This tool function code is for demonstration purposes to explain the concepts."

    "### Example: LangGraph (LangChain)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the LangGraph framework (From LangChain) to implement the same agentic system for our travel planner with three tools. Let's first install the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LangChain` provides a framework for developing applications that can leverage LLMs alongside other tools and data sources. In the context of agentic systems, `LangChain` provides a sub-framework known as LangGraph that is used to build powerful LLM agent-based workflows. LangGraph approaches agent-based travel planning through a workflow graph system, offering a different paradigm from both `CrewAI` and `AutoGen`. Let’s examine how this implementation works and its distinguishing characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph uses a state machine approach where the workflow is defined as a graph with nodes and\n",
    "edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation centers around two main nodes:\n",
    "- An agent node that processes messages and makes decisions.\n",
    "- A tool node that executes the requested tools (flight search, hotel booking, and activity planning).\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow follows a cycle where the agent node evaluates the current state and either makes tool calls or provides a final response. This is controlled through a function that interprets the model’s next\n",
    "move (that is, call a tool or end the response), which determines whether to route to the tools node\n",
    "or end the conversation. Just like CrewAI, LangGraph also uses the @tool decorator (for Python)\n",
    "with which the tool functions can be defined\n",
    "\n",
    "Once nodes are defined with or without tools, they can be connected to each other to build a full\n",
    "graph structure of the workflow. For example, in our case, the following code defines a state graph-\n",
    "based workflow using LangGraph, where a task cycles between two nodes: agent and tools. The graph\n",
    "starts at the agent node (defined as the entry point), which calls a function (call_model) to process\n",
    "input. After the agent runs, a conditional function (should_continue) determines the next\n",
    "node – either looping back to the tools node or ending the workflow. The tools node (tool_node)\n",
    "processes intermediate tasks and always transitions back to the agent node, creating a repetitive\n",
    "cycle until the conditional function decides to stop. A MemorySaver checkpoint is used to persist\n",
    "the state across runs, and the graph is compiled into a LangChain-compatible runnable. Finally, the\n",
    "workflow is invoked with an initial input message about planning a trip, and the final message content\n",
    "is printed after the graph execution concludes."

In such cases, you might want to provide a \"pick-up where you left off\" feature to your user. This can be implemented using a mechanism called \"Checkpointing\" with LangGraph using the `MemorySaver()` which introduces a level of data persistence of the entire state of the workflow. This can be a very powerful in various sitatuation such as pause-resume workflow, human intervention etc. Read more about checkpointing here - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/\n",
